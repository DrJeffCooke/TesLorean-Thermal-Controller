# TesLorean-Thermal-Controller
Arduino code to monitor drive and charging temps and control pumps and values

The thermal controller is similar to the module purpose in the Tesla Model S.  It listens for temperature information (via CAN) from around the rest of the car (drive unit, charger, battery) and modifies the operation of pumps, values, coolant heater, and chiller to keep coolant temperatures within operating limits.
